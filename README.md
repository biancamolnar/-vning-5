Instructions and purpose


The purpose with the exercise is by using various snippets, plugins and themes, the student will be able to understand and edit a website's CSS using Bootstrap. The aim is to test many  (or all) of bootstrap's possibilities, partly based on Bootsrap's own html code but also based on creating an own HTML skeleton which then uses Bootstrap.



The group themselves decide what the website is aimed at, but it is recommended to focus on the business world or associations active in the business world. Examples can be various (fictitious) businesses, a trade association, or informative pages about a business concern.



For this exercise, try to use Bootstrap as much as possible and only adjust things like texts, images, icons, fonts, colors, etc (without changinge the Bootstrap core code).



The website should display a sufficiently professional level for best practice on the Internet, in terms of content, layout and code quality.

You are not allowed to use Bootstrap themes in this course. But you should be aware of them, and feel free to use them in any other future course. Check them out!



Texts and images


Text should always be relevant to the content, but "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text is sufficient, except for for headlines and other places where the context otherwise does not make sense. Images are needed, and can be choosen from https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/. It is a good idea to choose images wisely according to what your group plans to do for targeting your site on your course submission.
